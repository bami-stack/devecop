# Grype configuration for security scan workflow
# Use with: grype --config scripts/grype-config.yaml <target>
# Or copy to .grype.yaml in project root for automatic loading

# Fail scan (exit code 1) if vulnerabilities at or above this severity are found
# Options: negligible, low, medium, high, critical
fail-on-severity: "high"

# Globs to exclude from scanning
exclude:
  - "./venv/**"
  - "./.venv/**"
  - "./.git/**"
  - "./node_modules/**"
  - "./__pycache__/**"
  - "./reports/**"

# Sort results by risk (EPSS/KEV aware) for prioritization
sort-by: "risk"

# Example: ignore specific CVEs (uncomment and customize as needed)
# ignore:
#   - vulnerability: "CVE-XXXX-XXXXX"
#     fix-state: "wont-fix"
#     package:
#       name: "some-package"
